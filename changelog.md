# Change Log

## 1.13.0

- ✨ **Squint Mode! (My "Opus"! 😂)** — Labels every non-whitespace character instead of words. Great for zoomed-in views, large fonts, or large monitors. Activate via `Jumpy: Toggle Squint Mode` from the command palette (suggested keybinding: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>). Try it!!!
- ✨ **Squint Selection Mode** — Combine squint mode with selection for precise character-level selections. Suggested keybinding: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>.
- ✨ **Tab to switch modes** — Press <kbd>tab</kbd> while in jump mode to toggle between Classic and Squint mode without exiting. Works both directions.
- ✨ **Invert Default Modes** — New command `Jumpy: Invert Default Modes (Classic/Squint)` swaps toggle behavior for the session. Useful if you prefer squint mode as your daily driver.
- ✨ **Mode status bar** — New status bar indicator shows "Classic" or "Squint" mode. Updates during jump mode. **Click** to invert defaults.
- 📝 Add vim/neovim keybinding suggestions for squint mode (`gs` and `gS`).
- 📝 Updated `README.md` with squint mode documentation.

## 1.12.1

- 🚀 Fix OVSX publish.

## 1.12.0

- ✨ Add support for Cursor and VSCodium! Will publish to the Open VSX Registry.

## 1.11.1

- 📝 Update `README.md` with telemetry note.

## 1.11.0

- ✨ Jumpy2 should now work on GitHub & the web! Try on https://vscode.dev/ or the '.' feature on GitHub's repo pages!

## 1.10.1

- 📝 Updated `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (see below) with an important urgent note about `customKeys` to enable digits (new feature in the recent 1.10.0 release).

## 1.10.0

- ✨ Jumpy2 should handle many more labels/jump targets now via fallback numeric characters. These numeric characters are new to Jumpy2 and remain lower in priority by default since they are harder to type. You should probably reset the `customKeys` setting to the new default which includes 0-9 as keys! (`jumpy2.customKeys`). The new value should read as `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`.
- 🐛 Fix label rendering bug at high numbers.
- 📝 Add note in `README.md` about more advanced/efficient `wordPattern`: `[^\s]{1,3}`. If you're reading this, you should probably try it!

## 1.9.0

## 1.7.1

## 1.7.0

- ✨ Add "checkered-mode" (alternate label colors like a checkers/chess board). See `README.md` for override details. Decided to make this mode the default so it's debatably a "breaking" change for users with extensive custom color overrides.
- Add LinkedIn link (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-l-goldberg-24607a314) since I'm looking for a job!

## 1.6.0
