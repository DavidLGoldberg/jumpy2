# Change Log

## 1.7.1

-   🐛 Avoid labeling co-pilot's embedded editors!

## 1.7.0

-   ✨ Add "checkered-mode" (alternate label colors like a checkers/chess board). See `README.md` for override details. Decided to make this mode the default so it's debatably a "breaking" change for users with extensive custom color overrides.
-   Add LinkedIn link (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-l-goldberg-24607a314) since I'm looking for a job!

## 1.6.0

-   🐛 Fix rendering of custom line heights!
-   ✨ Add ability to click Jumpy's status bar item to view your achievements.
-   Improve default `jumpy2.labelBorderColor` to improve clarity when labels are adjacent. Useful for more aggressive regexes.
-   ⌨️ Add link to https://bracklets.com (a typing training program I recently released).
-   ⬆️ Upgrade a lot of dependencies.
