A VS Code extension that creates dynamic hotkeys to jump around files across visible panes. It's a new 'Jumpy' but from the original author (Atom package) for VS Code. It works with the major VSC vim extensions and I plan to maintain it.

## How to jump

1. Hit <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
2. Choose from your presented labels:
3. Enter two characters.
4. Keep coding!

Watch the demo:

## Install

On command line:

```bash
code --install-extension davidlgoldberg.jumpy2
```

## Notes

-   Works great with or without [vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim "vim extension's homepage") or [neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim "neo vim extension's homepage")! See vim/nvim integration below
-   Vim modes supported:
    -   command mode
    -   insert mode
-   Recommended key mappings to replace 'f' in vim integration below.
-   Recommended key mappings for back and forward below.

## Key Bindings

### Defaults

-   Enter jump mode
    -   <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
-   Enter selection mode
    -   <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
-   Reset first character entered
    -   <kbd>backspace</kbd>
-   Cancel/exit jump mode (any of the following)
    -   <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
    -   <kbd>enter</kbd>
    -   <kbd>esc</kbd>
    -   <kbd>space</kbd>

## Jump back and forward

Did you know VS Code has built in backwards and forward navigation functionality? You should _probably_ map that to a hotkey for Jumpy!
I currently use the <kbd>backspace</kbd> key which overrides the default boring backspace functionality from vim (while in normal mode only of course).

For example with [vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) Edit this in your `keybindings.json` file:

```json
    {
        "key": "backspace",
        "command": "workbench.action.navigateBack",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && !inDebugRepl && vim.mode == 'Normal'"
    },
    {
        "key": "shift+backspace",
        "command": "workbench.action.navigateForward",
        "when": "editorTextFocus && vim.active && !inDebugRepl && vim.mode == 'Normal'"
    },
```

## Custom set of keys to use (easier to type / faster?)

```json
"jumpy2.customKeys": {
    "type": "array",
    "default": "fjdkslaghrueiwoncmv",
    "description": "Default characters to use"
},
```

The default might be easier for beginners. It is also probably better for larger screens (more labels before jumpy has to resort to utliizing uppercase letters).

```json
"jumpy2.customKeys": {
    "type": "array",
    "default": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
    "description": "Default characters to use"
},
```

## Colors & Border

To override Jumpy's default label colors (black on green) try this
In your VS Code's `settings.json` file:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "jumpy2.labelFontColor": "#000000", // black
  "jumpy2.labelBackgroundColor": "#ff0000", // on red
  "jumpy2.labelBorderColor": "#ffffff", // white border
  "jumpy2.beaconColor": "#ff0000af", // transparent red
},
```

_However_, it is probably wise to leave the defaults, and instead scope this to a theme or wildcarded (modified from [VS Code's examples](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_editor-syntax-highlighting) like so:

```js
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  // NOTE: not all dark and light themes are conveniently labeled "dark" or "light" like this.
  // In that case, you can specify per theme, or again, just leave Jumpy's default or override the default with the example above.
  "[*Dark*]": {
    "jumpy2.labelFontColor": "#000000",
    "jumpy2.labelBackgroundColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "jumpy2.labelBorderColor": "#FF0000",
    "jumpy2.beaconColor": "#FF0000AF",
  },
  "[*Light*]": {
    "jumpy2.labelFontColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "jumpy2.labelBackgroundColor": "#000000",
    "jumpy2.labelBorderColor": "#FF0000",
    "jumpy2.beaconColor": "#FF0000AF",
  }
},
```

## Vim integration

(_see neovim below if interested_)

### Override vim's extension level backspace

If you want the <kbd>backspace</kbd> key to work as the jumpy "reset" command you **must** define a "_user_" level keybindings override in `keybindings.json` to override vim's "_extension_" level keybinding:

```json
{
    "key": "backspace",
    "command": "jumpy2.reset",
    "when": "jumpy2.jump-mode && editorTextFocus"
}
```

(_feel free to bind it to another key as well_)

### Bind 'f' and/or 'F' key

if <kbd>f</kbd> vim functionality is desired:
open settings as json and add:

```json
  "vim.normalModeKeyBindingsNonRecursive": [
    {
      "before": ["f"],
      "commands": ["jumpy2.toggle"]
    },
    {
      "before": ["F"],
      "commands": ["jumpy2.toggleSelection"]
    }
  ],
```

## Neovim Integration

_NOTE: I haven't fully configured neovim but used it successfully for a while with the following_:

```json
{
  "key": "f",
  "command": "jumpy2.toggle",
  "when": "neovim.mode =~ /^normal$|^visual$/ && !jumpy2.jump-mode && editorTextFocus"
},
{
  "key": "escape",
  "command": "jumpy2.exit",
  "when": "neovim.init && jumpy2.jump-mode && editorTextFocus"
}
```

for back and forward functionality with neovim:

```json
{
  "key": "backspace",
  "command": "workbench.action.navigateBack",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !inDebugRepl && neovim.mode != 'insert'"
},
{
  "key": "shift+backspace",
  "command": "workbench.action.navigateForward",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && !inDebugRepl && neovim.mode != 'insert'"
}
```

## Fun

### See your achievements(!)

command palette (usually <kbd>command/ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) -> `Jumpy: Show Jumpy Achievements (career jumps)`
_(a real ninja would bind it to a key though)_

You can also _disable_ this pop up if you're an uber important 1337 10x h4x0r that can't afford to hot key a tab closed once a year...

```json
  "jumpy2.achievements.active": false,
```

### Emojis (Subtly useful)

Change the 'jumper' set (emojis)
in your VS Code's `settings.json`

add:

```json
  "jumpy2.jumperEmojis.jumperSet": ["üêí"],
```

_The above tells jumpy to use the monkey emoji exclusively._

Of course you can turn these off too. If you have no soul.

```json
  "jumpy2.jumperEmojis.active": false,
```

## Known Issues

-   Can not jump to treeview or tabs.

It offers focused and customizable drills, inspired by drumming rudiments, for developing muscle memory. Use it to learn any key, but especially those pesky brackets and curlies!
